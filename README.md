# Movie-lens-Recommender-System
PERSONALIZATION THEORY PROJECT

Course: E4571 Personalisation Theory, Fall 2019, Columbia University

Instructor: Prof. Brett Vintch

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To build a movie recommendation system for users.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
The objective is to recommend movies to all the users in our dataset. Two collaborative
filtering techniques have been implemented - namely the item-item based neighborhoodbased
and model-based. The idea is to find out what kind of samples and hyper
parameters build a model having good accuracy and then recommend movies for the
users using this model.
